# flask_gpt_chat
This flask app allows you to chat with a gpt model. You can specify which ever model you prefer by changing the model id. It is set to gpt-4 for now.

I made this thinking of a way that you might not need to purchase for the 20 dollar subscription for chatgpt + since some time I might not need to use gpt 4 as much. So openai's api saves quite a bit. Though I think it is not as convinient as chatgpt. 

## How to use
1. Clone the repo
2. Install the requirements
3. Run the `main.py` file
4. Go to localhost:5000
5. begin chat.

## Requirements
- Flask
- OpenAI
- Python3

## How to change the model
1. Go to the main.py file
2. Change the model id to the model you want to use.

You do need a openai api key for this to work.
